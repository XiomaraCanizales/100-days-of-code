# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple webpage listing some live YouTube videos.

**Thoughts:** I feel like the end result didn't represent a good use of time. I was frequently dealing with distraction from family members, while getting tired from simply approaching the end of a busy day, making it difficult to complete a relatively simple project. I want to come back to this project and improve it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the first lesson of #Javascript30, followed by modifying the project to be more unique.

**Thoughts:** I chose today's project as it was something my son could sit with me and not only follow along, but have fun testing with me. As the lesson pretty much handheld getting to the end result, I customized the project using the presented methods.
