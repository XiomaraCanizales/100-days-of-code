# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple webpage listing some live YouTube videos.

**Thoughts:** I feel like the end result didn't represent a good use of time. I was frequently dealing with distraction from family members, while getting tired from simply approaching the end of a busy day, making it difficult to complete a relatively simple project. I want to come back to this project and improve it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the first lesson of #Javascript30, followed by modifying the project to be more unique.

**Thoughts:** I chose today's project as it was something my son could sit with me and not only follow along, but have fun testing with me. As the lesson pretty much handheld getting to the end result, I customized the project using the presented methods.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second lesson of #Javascript30, including customizing the end result.

**Thoughts:** I again had my son sitting with me, and we had fun following along with the lesson, testing, and changing the project.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began work on small app for tracking some items

**Thoughts:** Used Laravel to shortcut on some basic functionality, but it's probably a little too much for the project. I might move my app to a smaller framework.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began creating plugin to alter display of siteId on Piwik

**Thoughts:** Approached this project with less confidence than usual, as I have minimal previous experience with using Piwik's API and wasn't sure how much work it'd take to make a "small" adjustment. I managed to find a couple plugins that behave similar to what I was after, just with different goals, and I feel certain I will be able to finish the project with a little more time.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Piwik plugin

**Thoughts:** I have the plugin partially completed, but am facing some difficulty inserting settings fields into the admin panel. I feel slightly bothered that I'm not sure where things are breaking, but not to point of frustration. Probably missing a basic (and "obvious") step, I'm going to look into it more tomorrow.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued coding Piwik plugin

**Thoughts:** I was able to find where I was getting tripped yesterday. As I suspected, I was missing something that was fairly obvious, not choosing variable names carefully enough. I still need to test my plugin more, but I'm at the point of doing more adjusting than creating new parts.
