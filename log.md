# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple webpage listing some live YouTube videos.

**Thoughts:** I feel like the end result didn't represent a good use of time. I was frequently dealing with distraction from family members, while getting tired from simply approaching the end of a busy day, making it difficult to complete a relatively simple project. I want to come back to this project and improve it.
