# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Being a self-taught developer is indeed challenging, as I grapple with the learning process and finding solutions to every hurdle I encounter. Although I've attempted to complete these challenges before, I often find myself giving up too easily.

I recognize that becoming a developer necessitates self-challenge and dedication to not only honing my coding skills but also cultivating discipline, consistency, and problem-solving abilities. Despite the difficulties, I remain passionate about coding and view these challenges as opportunities to push myself further.
